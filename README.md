# Artisan Delight Cafe POS System

Welcome to **Artisan Delight**, a virtual cafe celebrated for its exquisite cuisine, wide-ranging beverages, and delectable desserts. In pursuit of elevating the cafe's operational efficiency, I have meticulously developed a **Point of Sale (POS) System**. This sophisticated system is tailored for the streamlined management of customer orders and the seamless generation of transaction receipts. The project features a user-friendly interface that empowers users to effortlessly explore Artisan Delight's extensive menu offerings. This endeavor was crafted with utmost precision and dedication to fulfill the requirements of our _CIT10333P Midterm project_.

## Folder Structure

Within the workspace, you'll find the following five folders located within the `src` directory:

- **`logic`**: This directory houses all the Java logic responsible for the POS system's functionality, excluding user interface (UI) components.
- **`controller`**: The `controller` folder contains JavaFX controller classes that facilitate the interaction between the user and the application.
- **`ui`**: You'll discover FXML files and the POS user interface within this directory.
- **`img`**: The `img` directory is designated for storing UI assets, such as images and icons.
- **`styles`**: CSS files essential for styling the user interface are stored in the `styles` folder.

The main entry point for the application is `App.java`, which orchestrates the entire program.

## Dependencies

- **[JavaFX (version 21.0.1)](https://openjfx.io/)**: JavaFX is a powerful framework for creating Java applications with modern, hardware-accelerated user interfaces that are highly portable. It forms the foundation for the graphical user interface of the Artisan Delight Cafe POS System.
