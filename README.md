# CAFE POS SYSTEM

Welcome to **Artisan Delight**, a fictional cafe celebrated for its delectable food, beverages, and delightful desserts. In an effort to enhance the cafe's operational efficiency, I have developed a **Point of Sale (POS) System**. This system serves the purpose of managing customer orders and seamlessly generates transaction receipts. I have thoughtfully designed a user-friendly interface that allows users to explore Artisan Delight's extensive menu offerings. This project was meticulously crafted to fulfill the requirements of our _CIT10333P Midterm project_.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains five folders within the src directory, where:

- `logic`: contains all Java logic for the POS classes, excluding UI elements.
- `controller`: stores JavaFX controller classes.
- `ui`: includes FXML files and the POS UI.
- `img`: used for storing UI assets.
- `styles`: contains CSS files for styling.

Meanwhile, the `App.java` serves as the main Java file and runs the entire program.
